<p><cite>Avatar</cite>, marketed as James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction directed, written,produced and co-edited by James Cameron, and stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver.  The flim is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor.  The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of na'vi  a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora.  The flim's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.

<p><dfn>Avatar</dfn> derives from a Sanskrit word meaning "descent," and when it first appeared in English in the late 18th century, it referred to the descent of a deity to the earth-typically, the incarnation in earthly form of Vishnu or another Hindu deity.  It later came to refer to any incarnation in human form, and then to any embodiment(such as that of a concept or philosophy), whether or not in the form a person.  In the age of technology, "avatar" has developed another sense-it can how be used for the image that a person chooses as his or her "embodiment" in an electronic medium.
